# Survivor Sequence Framework: Foundational Definitions (Review Version)

I. Introduction

This report analyzes the core mathematical structures underpinning the proposed Harmonic Holographic Framework (HHF). The framework centers on Symbolic States (N), which are fundamentally linked to coprime integer pairs (i, j), positive rational numbers j/i, and canonical binary strings known as Christoffel words L(i, j). The generation of these states follows the well-established Stern-Brocot/Farey process, intrinsically connecting the structure to the modular group SL(2, ℤ). The framework also utilizes standard geometric embeddings of these states onto spaces like the real projective line (P¹(ℝ)), the circle (S¹), and the 2-sphere (S²). This analysis focuses on these established components and their interrelations.  

II. Symbolic States and Christoffel Words

The fundamental entities are the Symbolic States N, corresponding uniquely to pairs of non-negative integers (i, j) where i, j ∈ ℕ₀, (i, j) ≠ (0, 0), and gcd(i, j) = 1. This coprime condition ensures representation in lowest terms. The base states are N₀ = (1, 0) and N₁ = (0, 1).  

Each coprime pair (i, j) is bijectively associated with a canonical binary label L(i, j), the Christoffel word for slope j/i. Key established properties include:  

    Structure: L(i, j) has length n = i + j, containing exactly i zeros and j ones.   

Primitivity: L(i, j) is primitive (cannot be written as vᵏ for k > 1) if and only if gcd(i, j) = 1. This aligns with the definition of Symbolic States.  
Balance: Christoffel words are balanced, meaning factors of the same length have counts of 0s (and 1s) differing by at most 1. This reflects maximal uniformity.  
Relation to Sturmian Words: They are finite counterparts to infinite Sturmian words, sharing combinatorial properties. Factors of Christoffel words are factors of Sturmian words.  
Transition Count: For primitive Christoffel words (gcd(i,j)=1, i+j>1), the circular "01" transition count is k=1.  

Each Symbolic State N=(i,j) represents the rational number Val(N) = j/i (with Val(N₁) = ∞). The generation process ensures that the set {Val(N)} covers all non-negative rational numbers ℚ⁺₀ ∪ {∞} exactly once.  

III. Generation via Stern-Brocot/Farey Process and SL(2, ℤ) Connection

The set V of all Symbolic States (i, j) is generated by the standard Stern-Brocot or Farey process.  

    Mechanism: Starting with [(1,0), (0,1)], the process iteratively inserts the mediant (i₁+i₂, j₁+j₂) between adjacent pairs P₁=(i₁, j₁), P₂=(i₂, j₂) that are Farey neighbors. Two fractions (or pairs) are Farey neighbors if |i₁j₂ - i₂j₁| = 1.   

Completeness: This process generates all coprime pairs (i, j) exactly once, forming the Stern-Brocot tree structure.  
SL(2, ℤ) Link: The generation is algebraically equivalent to the action of the multiplicative monoid generated by matrices L = [1, 1]] and R = [[1, 1] within SL(2, ℕ₀) ⊂ SL(2, ℤ). A path from the tree root, represented by a word w in {L, R}, corresponds to a matrix M = μ(w). If M = [[p₁, p₂], [q₁, q₂]], the node corresponds to the coprime pair (q₂, p₂) (or similar, depending on convention), guaranteed coprime by det(M)=1.  
Continued Fractions: The sequence of L/R moves in the Stern-Brocot tree directly corresponds to the partial quotients in the continued fraction expansion of the rational number j/i.  

IV. Geometric Embeddings

The Symbolic States N=(i,j) can be mapped into standard geometric spaces:

    Real Projective Line (P¹(ℝ)): Mapping N to Val(N) = j/i places the states at the rational points P¹(ℚ) = ℚ ∪ {∞} on the real projective line P¹(ℝ). These points are the cusps for the action of the modular group PSL(2, ℤ) = SL(2, ℤ)/{±I} acting on the upper half-plane H via Möbius transformations. The orbit of ∞ under SL(2, ℤ) is precisely P¹(ℚ).   

Unit Circle (S¹): Identifying P¹(ℝ) with the boundary of the hyperbolic plane (e.g., the boundary of the Poincaré disk model), the Symbolic States map to these cusp points on S¹.  
2-Sphere (S²): Using standard stereographic projection, which maps the boundary circle S¹ to the sphere S², the Symbolic States can be mapped onto S². Since stereographic projection maps rational points to rational points, the images of the Symbolic States on S² are rational points.
