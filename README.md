# **Harmonic Holographic Framework: Established Structures and Symmetries**

## **I. Introduction**

This report analyzes the core mathematical structures underpinning the proposed Harmonic Holographic Framework (HHF). The framework centers on **Symbolic States** (N), which are fundamentally linked to coprime integer pairs (i, j), positive rational numbers j/i, and canonical binary strings known as **Christoffel words** L(i, j).1 The generation of these states follows the well-established **Stern-Brocot/Farey process**, intrinsically connecting the structure to the modular group **SL(2, ℤ)**.3 The framework also utilizes standard geometric embeddings of these states onto spaces like the real projective line (P¹(ℝ)), the circle (S¹), and the 2-sphere (S²).6 This analysis focuses on these established components and their interrelations.

## **II. Symbolic States and Christoffel Words**

The fundamental entities are the Symbolic States N, corresponding uniquely to pairs of non-negative integers (i, j) where i, j ∈ ℕ₀, (i, j) ≠ (0, 0), and gcd(i, j) \= 1\.1 This coprime condition ensures representation in lowest terms. The base states are N₀ \= (1, 0\) and N₁ \= (0, 1).  
Each coprime pair (i, j) is bijectively associated with a canonical binary label L(i, j), the **Christoffel word** for slope j/i.1 Key established properties include:

* **Structure:** L(i, j) has length n \= i \+ j, containing exactly i zeros and j ones.1  
* **Primitivity:** L(i, j) is primitive (cannot be written as vᵏ for k \> 1\) if and only if gcd(i, j) \= 1\.1 This aligns with the definition of Symbolic States.  
* **Balance:** Christoffel words are *balanced*, meaning factors of the same length have counts of 0s (and 1s) differing by at most 1\.1 This reflects maximal uniformity.  
* **Relation to Sturmian Words:** They are finite counterparts to infinite Sturmian words, sharing combinatorial properties.13 Factors of Christoffel words are factors of Sturmian words.2  
* **Transition Count:** For primitive Christoffel words (gcd(i,j)=1, i+j\>1), the circular "01" transition count is k=1.13

Each Symbolic State N=(i,j) represents the rational number Val(N) \= j/i (with Val(N₁) \= ∞). The generation process ensures that the set {Val(N)} covers all non-negative rational numbers ℚ⁺₀ ∪ {∞} exactly once.3

## **III. Generation via Stern-Brocot/Farey Process and SL(2, ℤ) Connection**

The set V of all Symbolic States (i, j) is generated by the standard Stern-Brocot or Farey process.3

* **Mechanism:** Starting with \[(1,0), (0,1)\], the process iteratively inserts the **mediant** (i₁+i₂, j₁+j₂) between adjacent pairs P₁=(i₁, j₁), P₂=(i₂, j₂) that are **Farey neighbors**.24 Two fractions (or pairs) are Farey neighbors if |i₁j₂ \- i₂j₁| \= 1\.24  
* **Completeness:** This process generates all coprime pairs (i, j) exactly once, forming the **Stern-Brocot tree** structure.3  
* **SL(2, ℤ) Link:** The generation is algebraically equivalent to the action of the multiplicative monoid generated by matrices L \= \[1, 1\]\] and R \= \[\[1, 1\] within SL(2, ℕ₀) ⊂ SL(2, ℤ).3 A path from the tree root, represented by a word *w* in {L, R}, corresponds to a matrix M \= μ(*w*).4 If M \= \[\[p₁, p₂\], \[q₁, q₂\]\], the node corresponds to the coprime pair (q₂, p₂) (or similar, depending on convention), guaranteed coprime by det(M)=1.4  
* **Continued Fractions:** The sequence of L/R moves in the Stern-Brocot tree directly corresponds to the partial quotients in the continued fraction expansion of the rational number j/i.15

## **IV. Geometric Embeddings**

The Symbolic States N=(i,j) can be mapped into standard geometric spaces:

* **Real Projective Line (P¹(ℝ)):** Mapping N to Val(N) \= j/i places the states at the rational points P¹(ℚ) \= ℚ ∪ {∞} on the real projective line P¹(ℝ).39 These points are the *cusps* for the action of the modular group PSL(2, ℤ) \= SL(2, ℤ)/{±I} acting on the upper half-plane H via Möbius transformations.39 The orbit of ∞ under SL(2, ℤ) is precisely P¹(ℚ).40  
* **Unit Circle (S¹):** Identifying P¹(ℝ) with the boundary of the hyperbolic plane (e.g., the boundary of the Poincaré disk model), the Symbolic States map to these cusp points on S¹.46  
* **2-Sphere (S²):** Using standard stereographic projection, which maps the boundary circle S¹ to the sphere S², the Symbolic States can be mapped onto S².6 Since stereographic projection maps rational points to rational points, the images of the Symbolic States on S² are rational points.6

## **V. Summary of Established Structures**

The Harmonic Holographic Framework integrates several well-established mathematical concepts. Its **Symbolic States** provide a unified representation linking coprime integer pairs (i, j), positive rational numbers j/i, and primitive **Christoffel words** L(i, j).1 The generation of these states via the **Stern-Brocot/Farey process** is rigorously defined and known to enumerate all positive rationals exactly once.3 This generation mechanism has a direct algebraic counterpart in the action of the **SL(2, ℤ)** matrix monoid generated by L and R, which is also fundamentally connected to **continued fractions**.3 Standard **geometric embeddings** map these states to the rational points (cusps) on the real projective line P¹(ℝ) and the boundary circle S¹ of the hyperbolic plane, and further onto rational points on the 2-sphere S² via stereographic projection.6 These confirmed components provide a solid mathematical foundation based on known results in number theory, combinatorics on words, group theory, and geometry.
